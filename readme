I used maven to build this project. Used mvn clean install to build the project
Application is the main program which takes the csv file as input
In the problem statement, it says input is an array of data. But since I have the data in csv file,
I am passing the .csv file as input to the application.
CSVParser, parses and stores into CSVRecord
BetaCalculationEngine, reads the processes the csv records and stores it in cache. calculateBeta function
can be called to calculate beta for stock
HelperUtils has methods to calculate beta of stock, compute covariance and variance

I used Map of Map to store the data. I used map since it is a O(1) lookup. This is a read heavy application.
If the input data is too big in the future, map can be changed to concurrentHashmap and we can split the
input csv file into chunks and have multiple threads process the data

Few assumptions

On the first day, I am storing daily return as 0 (I don't know what the daily return on the first day should be)
I am also assuming this market data will be present for all tickers during business days.

While processing the input file, I am computing the daily return and storing it for faster look up
during computation.

test folder contains some junits to test the code
